/**
 * A special operator for the subtraction of two DATETIMEs. The format of DATETIME subtraction is:
 *
 * <blockquote><code>"(" &lt;datetime&gt; "-" &lt;datetime&gt; ")" &lt;interval qualifier&gt;</code></blockquote>
 *
 * This operator is special since it needs to hold the additional interval qualifier specification, when in {@link SqlCall} form.
 * In {@link RexNode} form, it has only two parameters, and the return type describes the desired type of interval.
