 * Contains all of the {@link org.slf4j.Logger tracers} used within org.polypheny.db.class libraries.
 *
 * <h3>Note to developers</h3>
 *
 * Please ensure that every tracer used in org.polypheny.db.is added to this class as a <em>public static final</em> member called <code><i>component</i>Tracer</code>. For example, {@link #getPlannerTracer} is the
 * tracer used by all classes which take part in the query planning process.
 *
 * The javadoc in this file is the primary source of information on what tracers are available, so the javadoc against each tracer member must be an up-to-date description of what that tracer does.
 *
 * In the class where the tracer is used, create a <em>private</em> (or perhaps <em>protected</em>) <em>static final</em> member called <code>tracer</code>.
