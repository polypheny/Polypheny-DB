 * Rule to convert an {@link Join inner join} to a {@link Filter filter} on top of a {@link Join cartesian inner join}.
 *
 * One benefit of this transformation is that after it, the join condition can be combined with conditions and expressions above the join. It also makes the <code>FennelCartesianJoinRule</code> applicable.
 *
 * The constructor is parameterized to allow any sub-class of {@link Join}.
