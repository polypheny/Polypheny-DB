/**
 * Metadata about a relational expression.
 *
 * For particular types of metadata, a sub-class defines one of more methods to query that metadata. Then a {@link AlgMetadataProvider} can offer those kinds of metadata for particular sub-classes of {@link AlgNode}.
 *
 * User code (typically in a planner rule or an implementation of {@link AlgNode#computeSelfCost(AlgOptPlanner, AlgMetadataQuery)}) acquires a {@code Metadata} instance by calling {@link AlgNode#metadata}.
 *
 * A {@code Metadata} instance already knows which particular {@code AlgNode} it is describing, so the methods do not pass in the {@code AlgNode}. In fact, quite a few metadata methods have no extra parameters. For instance, you can
 * get the row-count as follows:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre><code>
 * {@link AlgNode} alg;
 * double rowCount = alg.metadata(RowCount.class).rowCount();
 * </code></pre></blockquote>
