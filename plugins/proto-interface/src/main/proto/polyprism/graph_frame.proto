The GraphFrame message is a placeholder intended to represent graph frames as part of the labeled property graph model.
As of now, the graph model is not fully implemented, making this message void of fields.
It acts as a provision for future developments where fields related to the graph model will be added.
Currently, this message does not contain any fields. It is reserved for future use when the graph model is more completely realized.
