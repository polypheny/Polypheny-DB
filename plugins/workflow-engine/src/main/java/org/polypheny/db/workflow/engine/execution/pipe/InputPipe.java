     * For performance reasons, the returned iterator must be used carefully.
     * It is recommended to use a single enhanced for loop for iterating over all input values.
     * Please note the following restrictions:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>Only a single iterator can ever be returned.</li>
     *     <li>For graphs, the convention is that first all nodes are piped, followed by all edges.</li>
     *     <li>If the iterator is used directly, make sure to only call {@code next()} if {@code hasNext()} has been called immediately before and returned true.</li>
     *     <li>Calls to {@code hasNext()} must be separated by exactly one call to {@code next()}. Otherwise, you risk skipping over elements, as some implementations retrieve the actual next element during hasNext().</li>
     * </ul>
